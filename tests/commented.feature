# Feature: Testing Sphinx Writer

#     Test the ability to write Gherkin data to a SphinxWriter object

#     Background: Some requirements for this test
#         Given that this file exists

#     @quarantined @JIRA-1234
#     Scenario: Test a Scenario

#         A scenario is quicker to write than a outline but less robust.

#         Given a test feature
#         When the suite reaches a scenario
#         Then the file is converted into rST

#     Scenario Outline: Test a Scenario Outline

#         A scenario outline helps you avoid confusing duplication.

#         Given I put <thing> in a blender
#         When I turn the blender on
#         Then it should transform into <other thing>

#         Examples: Fruit
#             | thing  | other thing |
#             | apple  | apple sauce |
#             | banana | smoothie    |
